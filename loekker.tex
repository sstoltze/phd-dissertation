\fixme{Skal stadig nok revideres en del.}

We now return to the general case. We want to show that the limit
space
$X_{m,\infty}$ is equivalent to the space of loops in the flag
manifold $\GLB{m}$.

\begin{definition}
  The loop space $\Omega = \Omega(\GLB{m})$ is the space
  \[ \Omega = \set{\g : [0,1] \to \GLB{m} \mid \g(0) = \g(1) =
    [\Id]} \]
  with the compact-open topology. 
\end{definition}

\begin{remark} \fixme{Flyt til introduktions-området. Hvis intet
    introduktions-område, så skriv om og inkluder de vigtigste
    resultater fra Milnor her uden bevis}
  Following \cite[Chapter 17]{milnor}, the compact-open topology is
  also the topology given by two loops being close if they are close
  at every point, with the metric
  \[ d(\g,\g') = \max_{t\in[0,1]} \widetilde d (\g(t),\g'(t)), \]
  where $\widetilde d$ is a metric on $\GLB{m}$ induced from a
  Riemannian metric. The space $\Omega$ is homotopy equivalent to the
  space of piecewise smooth loops with a slightly modified metric, and
  we will generally choose the most convenient model for our
  arguments.

\section{The map $X_{m,n}\to\Omega$}

As has been done before, we will start by considering $Y_{m,n}$ and
then quotient out with the torus $\T^n$ afterwards.
For $A = [a_1,\dots,a_n]\in Y_{m,n}$ we
can define a path $ \g_A$ in $\GL_m$ by starting with
$\g_A(0) = \Id$. Since the matrix $[e_2,\dots,e_m,a_1]$ is
invertible by the definition of $Y_{m,n}$, we know that $a_1$ is
linearly independent of $e_2,\dots,e_m$. Hence it can be written as
\[ a_1 = \sum_{i=1}^m c_i e_i, \]
with $c_1 \neq 0$. Rewriting the expression leads to the formula
\[  \frac{1}{c_1} a_1= e_1 + \frac{1}{c_1} \left(\sum_{i=2}^m c_i
  e_i\right). \]
This gives us a path in $\GL_m$ from the identity to
$\left[\frac{1}{c_1} a_1,e_2,\dots,e_m\right]$:
\[ [0,1]\ni t \mapsto \left[ e_1 + t\left(\sum_{i=2}^m
    \frac{c_i}{c_1}e_i\right),e_2,\dots,e_m \right] \in \GL_m. \]
This process can be continued, since we can rewrite the similar
expression for $a_2$ as
\[ \frac{1}{d_2}a_2 = e_2 + \frac{1}{d_2}\left(\sum_{i=3}^m d_i
  e_i\right) + \frac{d_1}{d_2c_1}a_1, \]
and get a path
\[ t\mapsto \left[\frac{1}{c_1}a_1,e_2+t\left(\sum_{i=3}^m
    \frac{d_i}{d_2}e_i +
    \frac{d_1}{d_2c_1}a_1\right),e_3,\dots,e_m\right] \]
that starts where the other path stopped. If we continue through the
vectors in $A$, we will eventually end at a point,
\[ [\l_i e_i,\dots,\l_me_m,\l_1e_1,\dots,\l_{i-1}e_{i-1}]\in \GL_m, \]
which is diagonal, except the columns may have been
permuted if $n$ is not divisible by $m$. Choosing a fixed path in
$\GL_m$ from $[e_i,\dots,e_{i-1}]$ to $\Id$, scaling the columns and
appending it to all the other paths then gives a path $ \g_A$ with
\[  \g_A(0) = \Id, \qquad \g_A(1) =
[\l_1e_1,\dots,\l_me_m]. \]

If we consider this as a path in $\GLB{m}$ we
get a loop, since $\g_A(1)\in\B_m$ is a diagonal matrix. The
assignment
\[ f(A) = \g_A \in \Omega(\GLB{m}) \]
defines a continuous function from $Y_{m,n}$ to the loop space. Note
that \fixme{Argumenter for kontinuitet?}
this function descends to the quotient space $X_{m,n}=Y_{m,n}/\T^n$, since
elements of $Y_{m,n}$ that are equivalent under the $\mathrm{T}^n$-action gives
paths in $\GL_m$ that are equivalent under the $\mathrm{B}_m$-action.

The goal of this chapter is to prove the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}
  The map $f : X_{m,n} \to \Omega$ induces a map
  \[ f : X_{m,\infty} \to \Omega. \]
  This is a homotopy equivalence.
\end{theorem}

Since the space $\Omega$ is relatively well-studied, this gives
information about $X_{m,\infty}$. In particular, it allows us to
calculate the homology and cohomology of this space.

We want to show that the stabilisation map
\begin{align*}
  s : X_{m,n} &\to X_{m,n+1} \\
  A\cdot \T^n = (a_1,\dots,a_n)\cdot \T^n 
              &\mapsto \left(La_1,\dots,La_n,
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 \\
      \vdots\\
      1
    \end{pmatrix} 
\right) \cdot \T^n = (LA,Le_1) \cdot \T^n
\end{align*}
does not affect the map $f$, or more precisely that $f$ induces a
well-defined map on $X_{m,\infty}$. To do this we will work with the
subsequence $X_{m,nm}$ of the sequence $X_{m,n}$, as the two limits
are isomorphic. \fixme{Argumenter for at grænserne er isomorfe?} To
ease the notation, we will leave out the coset specifier $\cdot \T^n$
when discussing elements of $X_{m,n}$ for the remainder of this
chapter.

We will show that the diagram
\[ \xymatrix{ X_{m,nm} \ar[rr]^{s^m}\ar[dr]_f & & X_{m,(n+1)m}
  \ar[dl]^f \\
  & \Omega & } \]
commutes up to homotopy. This is done by showing that the map $s^m$ is
homotopic to the map $\widetilde s$ that inserts the identity on the
last $m$ columns of $A \in X_{m,nm}$:
\[ \widetilde s (a_1,\dots,a_{nm}) =
(a_1,\dots,a_{nm},e_1,\dots,e_m). \]
If we connect $\Id$ and $L^{-m}$ by a path $\g$ in the space of
invertible lower triangular matrices, we get a homotopy
\[ s_t(A) = (\g(t)L^mA,
\g(t)L^me_1,\g(t)L^{m-1}e_1,\dots,\g(t)Le_1) \]
which goes from $s_0 = s^m$ to the map
\[ s_1 : A \mapsto (A,e_1,L^{-1}e_1,\dots,L^{-m+1}e_1). \]
The matrix $T = [e_1,L^{-1}e_1,\dots,L^{-m+1}e_1]$ is upper
triangular with entries given by the formula:
\[ T_{ij} = (L^{-j+1}e_1)_i = (-1)^{i-1}\binom{j-1}{i-1} \quad
\text{when } i \leq j. \]
This is proven by considering negative powers of $L$ and showing the
identity:
\[ (L^{-j+1})_{ik} = (-1)^{i-k}\binom{j-1}{i-k} \quad \text{when } i
\geq k. \] \fixme{Gør dette}
This is automatically true when $j$ is one, so assume it is true for
a given $j$. We will then show it for $j+1$. We are considering the
entry
\[ (L^{-(j+1)+1})_{ik} = (L^{-j})_{ik} = (L^{-1}\cdot L^{-j+1})_{ik} =
\sum_{l=1}^m (L^{-1})_{il} \cdot (L^{-j+1})_{lk}. \]
But if we use that $L^{-1}$ has entries
\[ (L^{-1})_{il} =
\begin{cases}
  -1 & l = i-1 \\
  1 & l = i  \\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}, \] \fixme{Skriv dette når $L^{-1}$ introduceres}
this simplifies to
\begin{align*}
  (L^{-(j+1)+1})_{ik} &= (-1)\cdot(-1)^{i-1-k}\binom{j-1}{i-1-k}
                        + (-1)^{i-k}\binom{j-1}{i-k} \\
                      &= (-1)^{i-k}\cdot \left( \binom{j-1}{i-k-1} +
                        \binom{j-1}{i-k} \right)\\
                      &= (-1)^{i-k} \binom{j}{i-k} \\
                      &= (-1)^{i-k} \binom{(j+1)-1}{i-k}
\end{align*}
as desired. Since we are considering only the first column, we get
\[ T_{ij} = (L^{-j+1}e_1)_i = (L^{-j+1})_{i1} =
(-1)^{i-1}\binom{j-1}{i-1}. \]
As $T$ is an upper triangular matrix, it can be homotoped to
the identity without affecting the linear independence of the
columns, and the maps $s^m$ and $\widetilde s$ are therefore
homotopic. The composition
$f\circ \widetilde s$ is the same as $f$, except that the loop
$f\circ\widetilde s$ is stationary at the identity for a while before
it terminates. Putting it all together shows the following:
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:homotopycommute}
  The diagram
  \[ \xymatrix{ X_{m,nm} \ar[rr]^{s^m}\ar[dr]_{f} & & \ar[dl]^f
    X_{m,(n+1)m} \\
    & \Omega & } \]
  commutes up to homotopy and $f$ induces a map:
  \[ f : X_{m,\infty} \to \Omega. \]
\end{lemma}

\section{Homotopy equivalence}

To show that the map $f : X_{m,\infty} \to \Omega$
gives an isomorphism of homotopy groups, we will again follow
\cite{milnor}. For each element $U$ of $\SUT{m}$, we can find a 
geodesically convex open ball centered on $U$. Since $\SUT{m}$
is compact, there is some $\e > 0$ such that any ball of radius $\e$
or less is geodesically convex. By the same argument, we can also
choose $\e$ so small that for any two points $A= [a_1,\dots, a_m]$ and
$B=[b_1,\dots,b_m]$ in $\SUT{m}$, with the distance from $A$ to $B$ less
than $\e$, any $m$ subsequent vectors in the sequence
$(a_1,\dots,a_m,b_1,\dots,b_m)$ are linearly
independent. \fixme{Argumenter for dette?}
With this, we get an increasing sequence of open sets in $\Omega$,
defined by requiring the loops to be piecewise contained in a ball of
radius $\e$:
\[ \Omega_k = \set{\g \in \Omega \delim \Big\vert\delim
  \g_{\left|\left[ \frac{j-1}{2^k},\frac{j}{2^k} \right]\right.} \text{ is
  contained in an $\e$-ball $\mathrm{B}_\e$} }. \]
By the choice of $\e$ made above, we can define a map
\begin{align*}
  \varphi_k : \Omega_k &\to X_{m,(2^k-1)m} \\
  \g &\mapsto \left[ \g\left(\frac{1}{2^k}\right),
    \g\left(\frac{2}{2^k}\right), \dots,
    \g\left(\frac{2^k-1}{2^k}\right) \right].
\end{align*}
Note that $\g(t)$ is an element of $\SUT{m}$, so the notation
$[\g(t),\dots]$ is shorthand for $[\g(t)e_1,\dots,\g(t)e_m,\dots]$.
The map is continuous since two paths being close in $\Omega_k$ means
that the maximum distance between them is small. But this translates
to the vectors of the image being close together. The maps $\varphi_k$
and $\varphi_{k+1}$ are related in the following fashion:

\begin{lemma}
  \label{lem:com}
  The following diagram commutes up to homotopy:
  \[ \xymatrix{\Omega_k \ar@{^(->}[r] \ar[d]^{\varphi_k} & \Omega_{k+1}
  \ar[d]^{\varphi_{k+1}} \\
  X_{m,(2^k-1)m} \ar[r]^{s} & X_{m,(2^{k+1}-1)m}. } \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The proof is by direct computation.
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi_{k+1} &= \left( \g \mapsto \left[
        \g\left(\frac{1}{2^{k+1}}\right),
        \g\left(\frac{2}{2^{k+1}}\right), \dots,
        \g\left(\frac{2^{k+1}-1}{2^{k+1}}\right) \right]\right) \\
    &\simeq \left(\g \mapsto \left[ \g\left(\frac{2}{2^{k+1}}\right),
      \g\left(\frac{2}{2^{k+1}}\right),
      \g\left(\frac{4}{2^{k+1}}\right), \dots,
      \g\left(\frac{2^{k+1}}{2^{k+1}}\right) \right]\right) \\
    &\simeq \left(\g\mapsto \left[ \g\left(\frac{1}{2^{k}}\right),
      \g\left(\frac{2}{2^{k}}\right), \dots,
      \g\left(\frac{2^k-1}{2^k}\right), \Id,\dots,\Id \right] \right)\\
    &= s\circ \varphi_k.
  \end{align*}
  The first homotopy is given by sliding along the minimal geodesic
  between the points and gives an allowed path by our choice of
  $\e$. The second homotopy is somewhat similar. If $(a_1,\dots,a_m)$
  and $(b_1,\dots,b_m)$ are two elements of $\SUT{m}$ and we have an
  element of $X_{m,n}$ of the form
  \[ \left[ \dots, a_1,\dots,a_m,a_1,\dots,a_m,b_1,\dots,b_m,\dots
  \right], \]
  then we can change the middle columns one by one, as we did in
  the construction of $f$, and get a path in $X_{m,n}$ that changes
  the middle from $[a_1,\dots,a_m]$ to $[b_1,\dots,b_m]$:
  \begin{align*}
    \left[a_1,\dots,a_m,a_1,a_2,\dots,a_m,b_1,\dots,b_m \right] 
    &\leadsto
    \left[a_1,\dots,a_m,b_1,a_2,\dots,a_m,b_1,\dots,b_m\right] \\ 
    &\leadsto
    \left[a_1,\dots,a_m,b_1,b_2,\dots,a_m,b_1,\dots,b_m\right] \\  
    &\leadsto
    \left[a_1,\dots,a_m,b_1,b_2,\dots,b_m,b_1,\dots,b_m\right].  
  \end{align*}
  This allows us to take all the repetitions
  $\left[\dots,\g(t),\g(t),\dots\right]$ and move them to the end as
  diagonal matrices, which results in the stabilisation map $s$.
\end{proof}

The above lemma shows that the maps $\varphi_k$ fit together to define
a map from $\Omega$ to $X_{m,\infty}$.
The idea is to use the maps $\varphi_k$ as homotopy inverses of the
loop space map $f$. We are now ready to prove the result.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:loekker}
  The map $f : X_{m,\infty} \to \Omega$ is a homotopy
  equivalence, i.e. the map
  \[f_* : \pi_i(X_{m,\infty}) \to \pi_i(\Omega)\]
  is an isomorphism for all $i$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We will prove that $f$ is a weak homotopy equivalence. Since the
  loop space is a CW complex and $X_{m,\infty}$ is a limit of CW
  complexes, both of these are CW complexes by respectively Corollary
  17.2 and the
  appendix of \cite{milnor}.
  
  We will start with surjectivity. Let
  \[ g : W \to \Omega \]
  be a finite cell complex in $\Omega$. We want to show that we can
  construct a map $\widetilde g$ from $W$ to $X_{m,\infty}$ such that
  the composition $f\circ \widetilde g$ is homotopic to $g$.
  
  The image of $g$ is compact and hence contained in $\Omega_k$ for
  some $k$, since $\set{\Omega_k}_{k\in\N}$ is an open cover of
  $\Omega$. Consider the map 
  \[ \widetilde g = \varphi_k\circ g : W \to X_{m,(2^k-1)m}. \]
  Evaluating at a point $w\in W$ gives
  \[ \widetilde g(w) = \varphi_k(\g_w) = \left[
    \g_w\left(\frac{1}{2^k}\right),\dots,
    \g_w\left(\frac{2^k-1}{2^k}\right) \right]. \]
  Evaluating $f$ on this gives a path connecting the points
  $\g_w\left(\frac{j}{2^k}\right)$. But by our choice of $\e$, any
  such path is homotopic to the path connecting these points with
  minimal geodesics, so $f\circ\widetilde g \simeq g$.

  To show injectivity, let
  \[ g : W \to X_{m,\infty}\]
  be a finite cell complex with $f\circ g$ null-homotopic. We want to
  show that $g$ is null-homotopic in $X_{m,\infty}$. In the
  direct limit, a compact set is contained in the image of $X_{m,n}$
  for some $n$ (see \cite[Proposition~A.1]{hatcher} or
  \cite[Chapter~9.4]{may}), so $g$ is represented by a map:
  \[ g : W \to X_{m,n}. \]
  We will work with this representative. The map $f\circ
  g$ is null-homotopic in $\Omega$ and the image is compact, so it is
  contained in $\Omega_k$ for some $k$. By applying $\varphi_k$, we
  get a function
  \[ \varphi_k\circ f\circ g : W \to X_{m,(2^k-1)m}. \]
  Since $f\circ g$ is null-homotopic, this function is
  null-homotopic. But by the same argument that was used in
  Lemma \ref{lem:com}, the map
  \[ \varphi_k(f(g(w))) = \left[
    \g_w\left(\frac{1}{2^k}\right),\dots,\g_w\left(\frac{2^k-1}{2^k}
    \right)\right] \] 
  is homotopic to the stabilisation map
  \[ s(g(w)) = \left[g(w),\Id,\dots,\Id\right], \]
  with the homotopy given by sliding along the path $\g_w=f(g(w))$.
  So the map $g$ can be stabilised to a null-homotopic map, so it must
  be null-homotopic in $X_{m,\infty}$. This shows that $f_*$ is
  injective on homotopy groups.
\end{proof}

Since $f$ is a weak homotopy equivalence, it follows that it induces
an isomorphism on homology and cohomology groups. The Pontrjagin
homology ring of the loop space, with product given by loop
concatenation, has been calculated in \cite[Theorem~4.1]{grbic} as
\begin{align*}
  H_*(\Omega(\SUT{m})) \cong T(x_1,\dots,x_{m-1}) \otimes
  \Z[y_1,\dots,y_{m-1}],
\end{align*}
where $T(x_1,\dots,x_{m-1})$ is the tensor algebra generated by
$x_1,\dots,x_{m-1}$. The product has the relation $x_k^2 =
x_px_q+x_qx_p = 2y_1$ for $1\leq k,p,q\leq m-1$ and $p\neq q$. The
degree of $x_i$ is 1 and the degree of $y_i$
is $2i$. By the above result, this is also the homology of
$X_{m,\infty}$. The groups are finitely generated and torsion free, so
by the Universal Coefficient Theorem the homology and cohomology
groups are isomorphic as abelian groups.

\section{Other coefficients}
\label{sec:coef}

In the above, we did not use the structure of the complex numbers in
any noticeable way. In particular, we could replace them by the reals
or the quaternions without any change to the proofs. This immediately
gives us two theorems, very similar to Theorem
\ref{thm:loekker}. These require computing Borel subgroups and maximal
tori for various spaces, for which we refer to e.g. \cite[Example
6.7]{malle}.

\begin{theorem}
  The space $X_{m,\infty}^\R$ is homotopy equivalent to the loop space
  of the real flag manifold,
  $\Omega(\GL_m(\R)/\mathrm{B}_m) = \Omega(\SO_m/\mathrm{T}^{k})$, where
  $\SO_m$ are the $m \times m$ special orthogonal matrices and
  $\mathrm{T^k}$ is a maximal torus in the special orthogonal group,
  where $k$ is half of $m$ rounded down.
  
  By \cite{grbic}, the Pontrjagin homology ring of this space depends
  on whether $m$ is odd or even. For odd $m$, it is
  \[ H_*(\Omega(2k+1)/\T^k) \cong T(x_1,\dots,x_k)\otimes
  \Z[y_1,\dots,y_{k-1},2y_n,\dots,2y_{2k-1}] / I, \]
  where $x_i$ is degree 1, the degree of $y_i$ and $2y_i$ is
  $2i$, and $I$ is generated by the relations
  \begin{align*}
    x_1^2-y_1, x_i^2-x_{i+1}^2&,\quad 1 \leq i \leq k-1, \\
    x_a x_b + x_b x_a&,\quad a \neq b, \\
    y_i^2-2y_{i-1}y_{i+1}+\dots\pm 2y_{2i}&,\quad 1 \leq i \leq k-1.
  \end{align*}

  For even $m$, the homology ring is
  \[ H_*(\Omega(2k)/\T^k) \cong T(x_1,\dots,x_k)\otimes
  \Z[y_1,\dots,y_{k-2},y_{k-1}+z,y_{k-1}-z,2y_k\dots,2y_{2k-2}] /
  I, \]
  where $x_i$ is degree 1 and anything involving a $y_i$ is of degree
  $2i$. The relations are generated by
  \begin{align*}
    x_1^2-y_1, x_i^2-x_{i+1}^2&, \quad 1 \leq i \leq k-1, \\
    x_ax_b+x_bx_a&, \quad a\neq b, \\
    y_i^2-2y_{i-1}y_{i+1}+\dots\pm 2y_{2i}&,\quad 1 \leq i \leq k-2 \\
    (y_{n-1}+z)(y_{n-1}-z)-2y_{n-2}y_n+\dots\pm 2y_{2n-2}&. 
  \end{align*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  The space $X_{m,\infty}^\Hq$ is homotopy equivalent to the loop
  space of the quaternionic flag manifold
  $\Omega(\GL_m(\Hq)/\mathrm{B}_m) = \Omega(\mathrm{Sp}_m/\T^m)$.
  Here, $\mathrm{Sp}_m$ is the symplectic group and $\T^m$ is a
  maximal torus.

  The homology ring is
  \[ H_*(\Omega(\mathrm{Sp}_m/\T^m)) \cong T(x_1,\dots,x_m)\otimes
  \Z[y_2,\dots y_m] / I, \]
  with $x_i$ of degree 1 and $y_i$ of degree $4i-2$. The relations are
  \begin{align*}
    x_i^2 = x_j^2&,\\
    x_a x_b = -x_b x_a&, \quad a\neq b.
  \end{align*}
\end{theorem}

This then also gives the homology of $X_{m,\infty}^\R$ and
$X_{m,\infty}^\Hq$.


\section{Other stabilisations and the spectral sequence of
  $X_{m,\infty}$}
\label{sec:stabilitet}

Now that we know the space $X_{m,\infty}$, we can consider different
ways of reaching this space from the spaces $X_{m,n}(\sigma)$. The
first thing to note is that the space $X_{m,\infty}$, so far described
as sequences of linearly independent vectors $(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_k)$ in
$\C^m$ of varying length, may as well be described as infinite
sequences $(v_i)_{i=1}^\infty$ for which there is some $k$ such that
the matrix $(v_{k+r*m +1},v_{k+r*m +2},\dots,v_{k+(r+1)*m})$ is the
identity matrix for all integers $r \geq 0$, with the same
requirements for
linear independence. We could also consider sequences that are
infinite in the other direction, or
doubly infinite sequences
that start and end with the identity matrix
and get the same space. Likewise, $X_{m,\infty}(\sigma)$ could be
defined as doubly infinite series that start with the identity matrix
and end with infinite copies of $\sigma$. The homeomorphisms between
these spaces are the obvious ones of inclusion or cutting off the tail
or start of an infinite sequence. As we saw in the proof of Lemma
\ref{lem:homotopycommute}, the two inclusions of $X_{m,n}$ in
$X_{m,\infty}$ by either
using the stabilisation map $s$ or by adding on the identity matrix
are homotopic, so this does not change any of the above results. To
differentiate the two ways of stabilising, we will refer to the
inclusion by adjoining an
infinite sequence of identity matrices and permutation matrices as
\[ L_n : X_{m,n}(\sigma) \to X_{m,\infty}(\sigma). \]
This map is important since it respects the
filtration defined in \fixme{Indsæt reference}
\[ F_0 \subset F_1 \subset \dots \subset X_{m,n}(\sigma) \]
and hence defines a map between the spectral sequences of
$X_{m,n}(\sigma)$ and $X_{m,\infty}(\sigma)$. These spectral sequences
are defined exactly as for $X_{m,n}(\Id)$.

We will be using this map to prove the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:kollaps}
  The spectral sequence for $X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)$ collapses on the
  second page, with all cohomology concentrated in the first column.
\end{theorem}
At first this theorem may seem slightly strange, but since we know
that the spaces $X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)$ are homotopy equivalent for all
$\sigma$, since they are all equivalent to the loop space
$\Omega(\SU_3/\T^2)$, the theorem
just tells us that all the cohomology of $X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)$ can be
found in the $X_{3,\infty}(\sigma_{\emptyset})$ part of $F_0 \cong
X_{3,\infty}(\sigma_{\emptyset})\times T^2$.

\begin{proof}
  We will show that the spectral sequence for $X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)$
  is determined entirely by the torus-part. To see this, note that
  since all the spaces $X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)$ are equivalent, they all
  have the same cohomology ring $R$. The spectral sequence then has
  the form
  \[ R \otimes H^*(\T^2) \to (R\oplus R)\otimes H^*(T\times (D,D-0))
  \to R\otimes H^*(D_2,D_2-0). \]
  We know that the boundary map is the composition of the boundary map
  for $(D,D-0)$ and an inclusion of spaces,
  \[ d_1 = \delta \circ \imath^*, \]
  and we would like to show that $\imath^*$ essentially does
  nothing. We know that for cohomology classes $r$ and $t$, we have
  \[ \imath^*(r \otimes t) = \imath^*((r\otimes 1)\cdot (1\otimes t))
  = \imath^*(r\otimes 1) \imath^*(1\otimes t), \]
  so we need to know that happens in both these cases. The inclusion
  can be illustrated by considering a concrete example. Instead of
  reducing all the way to what would correspond to $X_{3,n-1}(\tau)$
  in the finite-dimensional case, we will use the torus action to make
  all of the
  the non-zero entries in the last column equal to one. For the
  inclusion 
  \[X_{3,\infty}(\Id)_{\set{1}}\times(D-0) \to
  X_{3,\infty}(\Id)_{\emptyset}, \]
  we get the map
  \[
  \imath\left(\begin{pmatrix}
      \matrow{r_1} & 0 \\
      \matrow{r_2} & 1 \\
      \matrow{r_3} & 1
    \end{pmatrix}, t_2, \varepsilon\right) = 
  \left(R\begin{pmatrix}
      \matrow{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}r_1} & 1 \\
      \matrow{r_2} & 1 \\
      \matrow{r_3} & 1
    \end{pmatrix}, t_2,\varepsilon\right). \]
  By inspection, when $\varepsilon$ is a fixed, small real number,
  this is just the usual inclusion
  \[ X_{3,\infty}(\Id)_{\set{1}} \to X_{3,\infty}(\Id)_{\emptyset}, \]
  and hence an isomorphism on cohomology\fixme{Burde nok liiiiiige
    argumenteres for...}. This means that 
  \[ \imath^*(r\otimes 1) = r\otimes 1. \]
  Likewise, we can see that
  if we choose our matrix to be e.g.
  \[
  A = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}, \]
  the inclusion does not change the rows of $A$ since we have
  quotiented out the torus action on the columns. Hence we conclude
  that we preserve the other part of the cohomology as well. All in
  all, we get
  \[ d_1(r\otimes t) = \pm r \otimes \delta(t). \]
  But we know the map $\delta$, and hence we can compute the map on
  the first
  column as
  \begin{align*}
    d_1(r \otimes t_1t_2) &= ( r\otimes t_2, - r\otimes t_1) \otimes
    [D,D-0] \\
    d_1(r \otimes t_1) &= (0, -r\otimes t_1) \otimes [D,D-0] \\
    d_1(r \otimes t_2) &= (r\otimes t_2,0) \otimes [D,D-0] \\
    d_1(r \otimes 1) &= 0.
  \end{align*}

  By doing the exact same thing for the second column, only including
  the non-zero maps and leaving out
  the class $[D,D-0]$ to ease on notation, we see
  \begin{align*}
    d_1( r_1\otimes t_2, r_2\otimes t_1) &= (r_1 + r_2) \otimes
                                           [D_2,D_2-0] \\
    d_1( r_1 \otimes t_2, 0) &= 0 \\
    d_1( 0, r_2\otimes t_1) &= 0
  \end{align*} \fixme{Gå over til det der column alignment...}
  But by using this we can compute the second page and see that it is
  concentrated as $R\otimes 1$ in the first column, as desired.
\end{proof}


\section{Cohomological stability}
\label{sec:costa}
Since we now know the space $X_{m,\infty}(\sigma)$ and its cohomology, it
would be nice to relate this to the cohomology of
$X_{m,n}(\sigma)$, for finite $n$. To do this, we specialise to the
case $m = 3$ in
everything that
follows. First, we need an offset that depends on the permutation
we are considering:
\begin{definition}
  Define a function $\lambda$ on the symmetric group of three elements
  by
  \begin{align*}
    \lambda(\sigma) &=
                      \begin{cases}
                        0, & \sigma = \Id \\
                        1, & \sigma \in \set{(1\,2),(2\,3),(1\,2\,3)}
                        \\
                        2, & \sigma \in \set{(1\,3\,2), (1\,3)}
                      \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

We will need to distinguish the spectral sequences for various
permutations. We will refer to the groups of the spectral sequence to
compute the cohomology of $X_{3,n}(\sigma)$ as $E_r^{p,q}(n,\sigma)$.

This section will prove the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:kostab}
  If $n \geq k + \lambda(\sigma)$, the stabilisation map
  \[ L_{n}^* : H^k(X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)) \to H^k(X_{3,n}(\sigma)) \]
  is an isomorphism.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof will proceed by induction on $k$. Our induction hypothesis
is divided into two parts, were we require the stabilisation to be an
isomorphism when $n$ is greater than $k+\lambda(\sigma)$, and
injective when $n$ is $k+\lambda(\sigma)-1$. The exact statement we
want to prove is the following:
\begin{hypothesis}[$I_{k-1}$]
  For all $r \leq k-1$ and all $\sigma \in S_3$, the following two
  statements hold:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The map $L_{n}^* : H^r(X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)) \to
    H^r(X_{3,n}(\sigma))$ is an isomorphism for $n \geq r +
    \lambda(\sigma)$.
  \item The map $L_{n}^* : H^r(X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)) \to
    H^r(X_{3,n}(\sigma))$ is injective for $n \geq r +\lambda(\sigma)
    -1$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{hypothesis}

By direct calculation, the
groups $H^0(X_{3,n}(\sigma))$ are all $\Z$ when $n \geq
\lambda(\sigma)$, so the isomorphism in $I_0$ is automatically
true. \fixme{måske bemærke noget med at injektivitet ikke giver mening
  her}

We now assume the hypothesis $I_{k-1}$ and want to prove $I_k$. Before
we start, we consider the spectral sequence for $X_{3,n+1}(\sigma)$
and observe how the different permutations that show up relate to each
other. This is summarised in the following table:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|cccc|}
  \hline
  \sigma & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\sigma_\emptyset} 
  & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\sigma_{\set{1}}} 
  & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\sigma_{\set{2}}} & \sigma_{\set{1,2}} \\
  \hline
  \Id & \Id & (1\;2) & (2\;3) & (1\;3\;2) \\
  (1\;2) & \Id & (1\;2\;3) & \Id & (1\;3) \\
  (2\;3) & \Id & (1\;2) & \Id & (1\;2) \\
  (1\;2\;3) & \Id & \Id & \Id & \Id \\
  (1\;3\;2) & (2\;3) & (1\;2\;3) & (2\;3) & (1\;2\;3) \\
  (1\;3) & (2\; 3) & (2\;3) & (2\;3) & (2\;3) \\
  \hline
\end{array}
\] \fixme{Leg med stregerne og tjek at det faktisk er rigtigt hvad der
  står...}
By considering the table, we can see the following inequalities for
the function $\lambda$:
\begin{align*}
  \lambda(\sigma) &\geq \lambda(\sigma_{\emptyset}), \\
  \lambda(\sigma) &\geq \lambda(\sigma_{\set{1}}) - 1, \\
  \lambda(\sigma) &\geq \lambda(\sigma_{\set{2}}) - 1, \\
  \lambda(\sigma) &\geq \lambda(\sigma_{\set{1,2}}) - 2. \\
\end{align*}
These will be used during the proof.

\subsection{Injectivity}

We will start by proving injectivity. Consider a permutation $\sigma$
and $n \geq k + \lambda(\sigma) - 1$. We will start by proving that
the stabilisation map
\[ s^* : H^k(X_{3,n+1}(\sigma)) \to
H^k(X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\emptyset})) \] 
is injective. Consider the spectral sequence for computing
$H^k(X_{3,n+1}(\sigma))$. Since we choose to stabilise from the left,
as discussed in Section \ref{sec:stabilitet} above, $L_n$
becomes a map of spectral sequences and respects the stabilisation map
$s$. Figure \ref{fig:injektiv} is an image of the first page of
the spectral sequence, with
\colorbox{isomorphism}{$E_1^{p,q}$} denoting that $L_n^*$ is an
isomorphism on the group and \colorbox{injective}{$E_1^{p,q}$} denoting
that it is injective.

    \caption{The $E_1$ page when we assume $I_{k-1}$ and $n \geq

\end{figure}

If the map 
\[ s^* : H^k(X_{3,n+1}(\sigma)) \to
H^k(X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\emptyset})) \]
is not injective, there is an element $\alpha$ of the kernel of the
boundary map that is also in the group 
\[ H^{k-1}(X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\emptyset})) \otimes t_1 \oplus 
H^{k-1}(X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\emptyset})) \otimes t_2 \oplus 
H^{k-2}(X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\emptyset})) \otimes t_1 t_2. \]
But on these last groups, the stabilisation map is an isomorphism so
we get an element $\widehat{\alpha}$ in the corresponding group in the
spectral sequence for $X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)$. Since the stabilisation
maps are maps of spectral sequences, we have
\[ 0 = d_1(L_{n}(\widehat{\alpha})) = L_n(d_1(\widehat{\alpha})) \]
But the right hand side is the composition of $L_n$, which we know by
the induction hypothesis to be injective, and the boundary map in the
spectral sequence for the infinite spaces, which we know to be
injective on the groups we are considering by Theorem
\ref{thm:kollaps}. So $\widehat{\alpha}$ must
be zero, and hence so is $\alpha$. This shows that $s^*$ is injective
when $n \geq k + \lambda(\sigma) - 1$. Now we consider the different
choices of $\sigma$.

\subsubsection{$\sigma = \Id$}

We know that the cohomology of $X_{3,\infty}$ is the inverse
limit of the cohomology groups of $X_{3,n}$ using the stabilisation
map, see e.g. \cite{may}. \fixme{Bedre reference?}
When considered in this way, the map $L_n^*$ is just the projection on
the corresponding factor. But if we project and get zero, we know that
the only possible lift to the next group is zero, since $s^*$ is
injective. Continuing like this, we see that the only element of
$H^k(X_{3,\infty})$ that can project to zero is the zero element, and
hence $L_n^*$ is injective in this case.

\subsubsection{$\lambda(\sigma) = 1$}

If $\sigma \in \set{(1\;2),(2\;3),(1\;2\;3)}$, we know that
$\sigma_{\emptyset} = \Id$ and that $n \geq k + \lambda(\sigma) - 1 =
k$, giving $n-1\geq k-1$. Consider the following commutative diagram:
\[ \xymatrix{ H^k(X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)) \ar[r]^{s^*}_{\cong}
  \ar[d]^{L_n^*} & 
  H^k(X_{3,\infty}) \ar[d]^{L_{n-1}^*} \\
  H^k(X_{3,n}(\sigma)) \ar[r]^{s^*} & H^k(X_{3,n-1}).
} \]
By the previous case, the map on the right is injective and so the
composition $s^* \circ L_{n-1}^*$ is as well. Since the map commutes,
this means that the left vertical map, $L_n^*$ must be injective as
well, as desired.

\subsubsection{$\lambda(\sigma) = 2$}

The last case has $\sigma_{\emptyset} = (2\;3)$ and proceeds exactly
as the previous case, using the injectivity that has already been
proved for this permutation and that $\lambda((2\;3))$ is
$\lambda(\sigma)-1$.
\[ \xymatrix{ H^k(X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)) \ar[r]^{s^*}_{\cong}
  \ar[d]^{L_n^*} &
  H^k(X_{3,\infty}(\emptyset)) \ar[d]^{L_{n-1}^*} \\
  H^k(X_{3,n}(\sigma)) \ar[r]^{s^*} & H^k(X_{3,n-1}(\sigma_{\emptyset})).
} \]

\subsection{Surjectivity}

We will now prove surjectivity. Let $\sigma$ be a permutation in $S_3$
and let $n \geq k + \lambda(\sigma)$. As before, we start by proving
that the map
\[ s^* : H^k(X_{3,n+1}(\sigma)) \to
H^k(X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\emptyset})) \] \fixme{Vælg om L skal have stjerne
  eller ej}
is surjective. To see this, we will look at the spectral sequences for
$X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)$ and $X_{3,n+1}(\sigma)$, and the maps between
them induced by the stabilisation map $L^*_{n+1}$. This is summarised in
the following diagram. \fixme{Sørg for at notationen $E(\infty,\sigma)$
  etc er introduceret.}
\[ \xymatrix{ 0 \ar[r]\ar[d] & H^k(X_{3,\infty}(\sigma))
  \ar[r]^{i^*}\ar[d]^{L^*_{n+1}} & E_1^{0,k}(\infty,\sigma)
  \ar[r]^{d_1}\ar[d]^{A_0} & 
  E_1^{1,k}(\infty,\sigma) \ar[r]^{d_1}\ar[d]^{A_1} &
  E_1^{2,k}(\infty,\sigma) \ar[d]^{A_2} \\
  0 \ar[r] & H^k(X_{3,n+1}(\sigma)) \ar[r]^{i^*} &
  E_1^{0,k}(n+1,\sigma) \ar[r]^{d_1} & E_1^{1,k}(n+1,\sigma)
  \ar[r]^{d_1} & E_1^{2,k}(n+1,\sigma) 
} \]
The upper row is exact, since it is part of the spectral sequence for
$X_{3,\infty}(\sigma)$ and this collapses at the second page. The
bottom row is a chain complex, by considering the spectral sequence,
and is exact at
$E_1^{0,k}(n+1,\sigma)$. To see this, consider the induction
hypothesis, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:surjektiv}.

      k+\lambda(\sigma)$.}
    \label{fig:surjektiv}
\end{figure}
If we pass to the second page of the spectral sequence, we
can see that at row $k$ the groups will no longer change, so we have
\[ H^k(X_{3,n+1}(\sigma)) = \ker d_1. \]
The map $A_1$ in the diagram is an isomorphism, since it is induced from
the maps
\[ L^*_{n} : H^{k-1}(X_{3,\infty}(\sigma_{\set{i}})) \to
H^{k-1}(X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\set{i}})). \]
But this is an isomorphism by applying the first part of $I_{k-1}$,
using the assumption 
\[ n \geq k+\lambda(\sigma) \geq
(k-1)+\lambda(\sigma_{\set{i}}). \]
The map $A_2$ is an isomorphism by the exact same argument.
This allows us to do a diagram chase: Consider an element $x$ in
$E_1^{0,k}(n+1,\sigma)$. Then $d_1(x) = A_1(y)$ for a $y$ in
$E_1^{1,k}(\infty,\sigma)$. But 
\[ A_2(d_1(y)) = d_1(A_1(y)) = d_1(d_1(x)) = 0, \]
so $y = d_1(z)$ for some $z$ in $E_1^{0,k}(\infty,\sigma)$. The
element $x - A_0(z)$ is in the kernel of $d_1$,
\[ d_1(x - A_0(z)) = d_1(x) - A_1(d_1(z)) = d_1(x) - A_1(y) = 0. \]
So there is a $w$ in $H^k(X_{3,n+1}(\sigma)$ with $i^*(w)$ equal to
$x-A_0(z)$. So we have found $w$ and $z$ with
\[ A_0(z) + d_1(w) = A_0(z) + x - A_0(z) = 0, \]
showing that
\[ \xymatrix{ H^k(X_{3,n+1}(\sigma)) \oplus E_1^{0,k}(\infty,\sigma)
  \ar[r]^{i^* + A_0} & E_1^{0,k}(n+1,\sigma) } \]  \fixme{Ryk rundt på

is surjective. The map $s^*$ that we are considering is the
composition
\[ \xymatrix{ H^k(X_{3,n+1}(\sigma)) \ar[r]^{i^*} &
  E_1^{0,k}(n+1,\sigma) = H^k(X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\emptyset}\times T^2))
  \ar[r]^{\pr} & H^k(X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\emptyset})). } \]
The projection, which is induced from the inclusion of
$X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\emptyset})$ into the product, is surjective, so we
only need to show that the image of
$E_1^{0,k}(\infty,\sigma)$ is contained in the image of $s^*$ to
finish the proof of surjectivity. Consider the diagram
\[ \xymatrix{ E_1^{0,k}(\infty,\sigma) \ar[r]^{A_0} \ar[d]^{L_{n+1}^*}
  & E_1^{0,k}(n+1,\sigma) \ar[d]^{\pr} \\
  H^k(X_{3,\infty}(\sigma_{\emptyset})) \ar[r]^{L_n^*} &
  H^k(X_{3,n}(\sigma_{\emptyset})). } \] \fixme{Bør lige tjekke at
  alle afbildninger hedder det rigtige her...}
This shows that $\pr\circ A_0$ is contained in the image of
$L_n^*$. But the stabilisation map $L_n$ factors up to homotopy over
$s$, so we are finished and the induction hypothesis $I_k$ holds.
\end{proof}

% \section{Future work}

% In the above, we showed that the space 
% \[ X_{m,\infty} = \varinjlim_n X_{m,n}/\mathrm{T}^n \]
% is equivalent to the loop space $\Omega(\SUT{m})$ and used this to
% calculate the homology and cohomology groups of the limit. The
% current aim of the project is to work with the spaces $X_{m,n}$
% directly and see what we can prove about these, in particular by using
% the stabilization map
% \[ s : X_{m,n} \to X_{m,n+1} \]
% The conjecture at the moment is the following:
% \begin{conjecture}
%   The induced maps on cohomology
%   \[ s^* : H^*(X_{m,n+1}) \to H^*(X_{m,n}) \]
%   are always surjective and the induced maps on homology
%   \[ s_* : H_*(X_{m,n}) \to H_*(X_{m,n+1}) \]
%   are always injective.
% \end{conjecture}
% The idea for a proof would be to use a spectral sequence argument like
% the one applied to $X_{3,3}$ by defining a filtration that is easier
% to work with and then proceeding by induction, using that the maps
% $s^*$ and $s_*$ induce maps of the spectral sequences.

% Another thing to consider is modifying the space $X_{m,n}$. One possible
% change could be to replace $X_{m,n}$ by a union:
% \[ X'_{m,n} = \bigcup_{A\in\GL_m} X_{m,n}(A,A) \]
% This would allow all sequences of vectors that start and end at the
% same matrix, and one would expect the space $X'_{m,\infty}$ to be
% equivalent to the free loop space, consisting of all
% maps from the circle $S^1$ to $\SUT{m}$.

% There is also the option of replacing the complex numbers $\C$ with
% some other space, like the reals or quaternions. The fact that $\R^*$
% is not connected would most likely make the space $X_{m,n}^{\R}$ quite
% different, but possibly the space $X_{m,n}^{\mathbb{H}}$ would behave in a
% similar manner to $X_{m,n}$, with some shifts in dimension.
