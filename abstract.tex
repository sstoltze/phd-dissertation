%%%%%% Previous version, can probably be reused.

% The following document is part of the midway exam for Ph.D. students
% at Aarhus University. It describes the work I have done on my project
% so far, and
% ends with a small presentation of ideas for future work. Due to the
% limited number of pages, the report is meant more as an overview and
% will occasionally only sketch a proof or argument instead of giving
% all the details.

% I would like to thank Thomas Schmidt for proofreading an earlier
% version of this report, and my advisor Marcel B\"okstedt for his help
% and inspiration during the past two years.

% \subsubsection{Conventions and notation}

% What follows is a brief description of the notation used in the
% report.
% For two topological spaces $X$ and $Y$, we will write $X \cong Y$ to
% denote that $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic and $X\simeq Y$ to denote
% that they are homotopy equivalent. Likewise, $f \simeq g$ means that
% the maps $f$ and $g$ are homotopic. For subsets, we will use $A
% \subset X$ when $A$ is any subset of $X$, and we will generally not
% make a distinction between points of $X$ and one-point subsets of
% $X$. The set difference of $X$ and $A$ will be written as $X-A$. With
% a distinguished basepoint $x_0$ in $X$, the set of based loops in $X$
% will be denoted $\Omega(X) = \set{ \g : S^1 \to X \mid \g(1) = x_0}$,
% and this comes equipped with the compact-open topology. The one-point
% compactification of $X$ is $X^+ = X\cup \set{\infty}$.

% We will be working exclusively with topology in the complex numbers,
% so the disc $D$ is the unit disc in the complex plane $\C$ and $D_p$
% is the unit disc in $\C^p$. The non-zero elements in $\C$ will be
% written as $\C^* = \C - 0$. $\GL_m$ will denote the group of
% linear automorphisms of $\C^m$ and the standard basis of $\C^m$ is
% $e_1,\dots,e_m$. Linear maps will be written as matrices with respect
% to the standard basis.

% Since we are mainly concerned with algebraic topology, a space will
% occasionally be replaced with a homotopy equivalent one without
% mention. For example, $T^n$ will denote both the torus $(\C^*)^n
% \subset \GL_n$ and $(S^1)^n\subset \C^n$ depending on context, and the
% punctured disc $D_p-0$ will sometimes be identified with the sphere
% $S^{2p-1} \subset \C^p$. Likewise, we will not distinguish between the
% different models of the flag manifold of $\C^m$, given as $\GLB{m}
% \cong \UT{m} \cong \SUT{m}$ with $B_m \subset \GL_m$ the upper (or
% lower) triangular matrices in $\GL_m$, $T^m \subset \U_m$ the diagonal
% matrices in the unitary group and $T^{m-1}\subset \SU_m$ the diagonal
% matrices in the special unitary group.

% Homology and cohomology groups will always be singular groups
% with integer coefficients. If a theorem is mentioned by name without a
% reference, it can be found in \cite{hatcher}.
